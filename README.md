# T20 World Cup Data Analysis

## Requirement Scoping

This project involves collaborating with a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to analyze T20 World Cup data. The following steps outline the process:

## Data Collection

To gather T20 World Cup data, web scraping will be employed to extract relevant information from the ESPN Cricinfo website.

## Data Cleaning

Python and Pandas will be utilized for data cleaning and format conversion, ensuring that the data is in a usable and consistent format for further analysis.

## Data Transformation

Power Query will be employed to perform data transformation tasks, enhancing the quality and structure of the data for subsequent analysis.

## Data Modeling

Data modeling will be carried out, and parameters will be established using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX). This step is crucial for creating a solid foundation for the analysis.

## Dashboarding

Power BI will be used for creating interactive and insightful dashboards based on the cleaned and transformed data. These dashboards will provide a visual representation of the T20 World Cup data.

## Insights Collection

The final stage involves collecting meaningful insights from the data visualizations and analysis. This step aims to extract valuable information and draw conclusions from the T20 World Cup data.

## Instructions for Running the Analysis

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Run the web scraping script to collect T20 World Cup data from ESPN Cricinfo. (Script: `web_scraping_script.py`)

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Execute the Python script for data cleaning and format conversion. (Script: `data_cleaning_script.py`)

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Use Power Query to transform the cleaned data. Follow the steps outlined in `data_transformation_steps.txt`.

4. **Data Modeling:**
   - Implement data modeling and parameter creation using DAX. Refer to the DAX scripts in `data_modeling_scripts`.

5. **Dashboarding:**
   - Open the Power BI file (`T20_World_Cup_Dashboard.pbix`) to visualize the data. Ensure that Power BI is installed.

6. **Insights Collection:**
   - Review the dashboards and visualizations in Power BI to gather insights from the T20 World Cup data.
